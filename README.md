# CodeInPlaceProject
Hi this is the project submitted after finishing <b>Code In Place</b> Spring 2021 from Standford.
<br>I got to have hands on experience on CS106 from Standford. I also was able to learn:
<li> Control Flow in Python
<li> Expressions
<li> Images and Text processing
<li> Files
<li> Data Science
<br>during these 6 weeks, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these journey during the past 6 weeks.
